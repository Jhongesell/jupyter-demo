# jupyter-demo
Introducing basics of Jupyter Notebook (intended to be used in presentation / chat)

Often I need to introduce the notebook in a discussion, and everytime I look for a 
simple example on my file system. This repository is meant to be a substitute.

This can also be used to demo ipynb-file rendering on github (subdirectory 
`executed-notebooks`), or to demonstrate the MyBinder service.

Examples:

* 2-widgets: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/jupyter-demo/master?filepath=2-widgets.ipynb)
